  <div>
    <h2>Neuroplasticity</h2>
    <p>Neuroplasticity benefits people in a number of ways, overcoming fears, recovering from strokes, tending to autism
      and ADHD to be more manageable in day-to-day applications. It could be as simple as journeling everyday for 30
      minutes, sitting outside in peace or excersize. For me neuroplasticity can and hopefully will benefit with my self
      critical thinking. I have had the
      harsh realisation that I have a fixed mindset and when things become difficult I become negative, frustrated with
      myself and look for excuses. By staying consistent I hope to minimize this, if not just to make myself
      more confident within learning environments.</p>
    <p>I have a few small things that can help me, I know I have a mixed mindset, it just determines what I am doing and
      my environment. Obviously if we could answer all of our problems we would have no need to connect with others and
      learn from them.</p>
    <p>Here are a few ways I found I personally benefit and increase my neuroplasticity</p>
    <ul>
      <il>Playing guitar</il>
      <il>Going for walks</il>
      <il>Eating well, nourishing myself</il>
      <il>Proper sleep</il>
      <il>Self deprecative behaviour</il>
    </ul>
  </div>

    <h2>Growth Mindset</h2>
    <p>Growth mindset, is the ability to develop ones talents and understandings through hard work, strategies and the
      right interactions. The things we can and can’t do aren’t hardcoded, in fact are achieved through a mixture of
      appropriate steps that are in itself not set in stone. Everyones way of learning is different.</p>
    <p>I had a rather harsh realisation about myself when I found I wasn’t putting enough effort into EDA when I became
      frustrated because I didn’t understand something (it was The Dom!). I started making excuses and putting myself
      down, ultimately thinking about my education growing up.Triggering feelings and thoughts that were buried for a
      while.</p>
    <p>This may sound like a cop out answer, but it’ll be closely related with the list regarding how to increase
      neuroplasticity (for me personally).I don’t think it’d do anyone justice looking at a multitude of things and
      seeing so much at the time would look like imperfections, this will likely be overwhelming.
