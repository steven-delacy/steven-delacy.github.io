      <h2>What is a class?</h2>
      <p>A class is an element which can be applied to any aspect of HTML.
        This could mean one to two lines of code, or 50.
        The class tag once used in css / javascript will apply the same rules to anything that has that rule set
        applied.
      </p>
      <p>Example: If you wanted multiple parts of a paragraph or title to have the same background
        colour or styling in
        your .css file it’ll look something ,
        like this</p>
    </div>
    <!--Class images-->
    <div class="column justify-content">
      <img class="margin-bottom-small"

      <img src="/Users/steven/Documents/dev-academy/steven-delacy.github.io/styles/class-css.png" alt="class-css">

  </div>
  <div class="section topic2">
    <div id="what-id" class="column">
      <h2>What is an ID?</h2>
      <p>An ID is similar to a class but can only be used on one selected tag.
        Again, it can be used in all aspects of HTML and then manipulated with .css or .js.</p>
      <p>Example: Say you wanted to style that same paragraph/ title but you didn’t want it to effect any of the others
        on
        different pages of what you are working on.
        Well, we’d use an ID to define it, basically singling it out. Then we can style it with .CSS/ . JS however using
        those that have been targetted with these elements.</p>
