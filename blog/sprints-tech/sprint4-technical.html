    <h1 class="tech4 cult">Problem solving.</h1>
    <p>Approaching a problem especially when fresh and new to a coding language is tricky. It isn’t as simple as
      googling what you think you should search.
      Code words, various articles/forums. It can easily become overwhelming when the results look nothing like what you
      expected.</p>
    <p>Getting stuck on a problem happens more than often, and second guessing can be distracting.
      I overthought a process with how to add the first child in the Manipulating JS Objects exercise.A lot of cases
      simple is easier, not just for a students learning, but readability. I needed to simplify what I needed, and
      underestimated dot notations .. which ultimately helped me pass that point in the exercise. </p>
    <h2>Everyones approach is different</h2>
    <p>I feel more comfortable googling solutions, or even a hint at what I need to know to get the problem solving
      flowing. Not only is googling a great way to access information, a lot of the time you have to be oddly specific
      with what words you use. This helps me and my learning process understand what’s what in a plethora of material
      that makes up code.</p>
