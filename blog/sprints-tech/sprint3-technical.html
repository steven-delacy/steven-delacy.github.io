  <h1 class="tech3 title">JS and close relations</h1>
  <div class="center-txt">
    <h2>HTML: The cobbler, builder</h2>
    <p>The builder of your website, in a way HTML will react like the blueprints. This is where all the information you
      want to display will be located in various elements. This all depends on how you’d like it structured.

    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>
      CSS: The painter, architect.</h2>
    <p>The painter, an artist waiting to get their big break. Although the brush can only be as good as the artist. You
      can design, mix and match to your hearts content. All along with fine tuning and positioning that can make even
      the most seasoned artists take the time to appreciate the work put in.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>JS: The Wizard, this is witchcraft!</h2>
    <p>Movements, sounds, reactivity. All the works of probably the most used language of the modern internet. Creating
      actions that can be used as many times as you’d like. Behind closed doors there is a lot of logic and reactiveness
      being written and being read, and again, over and over.
      A movement of a button when you click it, the tilt of text ad you scroll (who knew g force was a thing in code
      huh), drop-downs even a form for signing up to a website.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Control flows, but what does it control?</h2>
    <p>How do you get to work, or where you want to go? Whatever has jumped to the front of your mind has a control
      flow, some being more complicated than others. Travelling using a vehicle is probably the most common and longest
      control loops we have in society today. Cars a fun and all but walking is fun too. So I going to go for a walk,
      what is the list of things I will need to check off before I leave? Apart from the the obvious the list for me
      would go:
      phone > wallet > keys > shoes > lock door > walk to wherever I want to go.
      As non-formal this example can be andthese items on the control checklist can change in priority, the Control flow
      would do it exactly the same way
      every-time!</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Loops, double time!</h2>
    <p>Loops! One that we all use from day-to-day life. Take brushing your teeth for instance, almost everyone will at
      least brush their teeth once a day. Now let's call this a function. This function, since we want it to be on a
      loop each day will be done until a stoping condition is met. A loop can be time sensitive if you require it to be
      just like the example with brushing your teeth.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>The Dom (Document Object Module) , the all seeing.</h2>
    <p>When you open a webpage, whatever and wherever it may be located we can look at the code.
      May sound complicated right, but in reality it isn’t. Depending on what OS you are using it could be as little as
      two clicks.

      The Dom can and will provide you a live preview of the code being used on whatever website you have accessed. From
      the various paths of code, showing what CSS rules have been applied and Analytics.

      With the ability to change code and restyle CSS on the fly with live previews. The DOM is a rather valuable
      addition to web browsers for web developers. This isn’t all it can do though, with a column of what looks like an
      artillery of different tabs including a console to code and a memory management system, the DOM is a Don!</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Arrays & Objects, the collector.</h2>
    <p>Both arrays & objects are collections of JS datasets. Think of an array as a newspaper pages, or a series of
      books. JS starts counting from 0 and ends with 9. Lord Of The Rings, but each book would be numbered like 0, 1 and
      2 because in JS the count starts at 0.
      This is how we would select the item from the array.
      However we name the items in the array would correspond how we count in JS so [ 1 ] would be the second book in
      the series or LOTR: The Two Towers and so forth.</p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <h2>Functions, don’t expect Skynet to come from this.</h2>
    <p>Instead of SkyNet, think sandwiches. Think of the functions structure as the same as the ingrediance which go
      into making a sandwich. Yes, there are endless possibilities on how to make one, however for examples sake we’ll
      make it simple.Our sandwich will comprise of lettuce, salami and bread.it’ll be structured like this:

      function makeSandwich(salami, lettuce, bread){
      Let sandwich = salami + lettuce + bread;
      Return SANDWICH!
      }

      May be the most complicated way to make a sandwich, but if you are as accustomed to coding JS as you are at making
      sandwiches then it’ll be quite simple.</p>
