  <p>
    After you study or learn new skills, you have to reasses you plans right?
    Long after I graduate EDA, I would ideally want to be working part time as
    a dev/contractor while working towards a personal business goal of my own.
    This goal with definitely require the teachings I will endure at EDA and
    is definitely acting as those important first steps to achieving this path
    I would like to walk down in my careers future.
  </p>

  <p>
    These goals wont just require technical skills in the short or long term,
    but there is one main thing I'd like to improve on with my time at EDA
    (but isn't limited to). This is, asking for help. It's very possible that
    this could be a flow on effect of anxiety which effects other parts of
    everyones lives to an extent.
  </p>

  <h3>Strengths</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Working well with others</li>
    <li>Kindness and respect</li>
    <li>Reassurance</li>
    <li>Resiliance</li>
    <li>Time management</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Limitations</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Difficulty asking for help</li>
    <li>Anxiety</li>
    <li>Burnout</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    In the past I have usually worked rather independently wherever it may be,
    however when the time comes to work in a group I find a great power in the
    brainstorming, problem solving and the different ways others can think can
    compliment each other in a work environment. That doesn’t mean that
    everyone needs to do their part with deadlines, scheduling and planning.
  </p>

  <p>
    Seeking help from others can be quite daunting for some. Depending on what
    information you are trying to gain, it's never a bad idea to consult
    Google. Others who are near could give you a quicker response than
    searching the internet so make sure to ask your facilitators, and other
    members of your cohort.
  </p>

  <p>
    I think the facilitators have already made it pretty clear that they are
    there to help as much as they can. I don’t expect them to solve everything
    for myself or anyone else in the cohort. They are and have been providing
    a great learning experience for a while now which I consider myself lucky
    to be attending.
  </p>

  <p>
    Coming straight from full-time work there are a few habits that are still
    fresh in my mind. These which i'm hoping will help ease some planning and
    scheduling hardships I may come accross during the bootcamp.
