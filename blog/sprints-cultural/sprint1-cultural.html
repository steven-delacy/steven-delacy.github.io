  <p>I'm going to be upfront. I asked a college from my old job, a trusted friend and my mum.
    Only my mum got back to me on this. It sucks but it is what it is, I will update this when I get around to ask
    others who I think would actually provide me with an answer.

    My personal values are pretty straight forward. Integrity, honesty, kindness, respect etc.But then again I do have a
    side from my teenage years which rebelled and butts heads when people are being inconsiderate or rude.
  </p>
  <p>A lot of what I haven learned in my life has been through hard lessons, by experiencing myself or observing
    others.Something that haunted a 5 year old Steven for longer than I’d like to admit is.I stole a kids HotWheels car,
    he was a couple years older than me and when he found out basically blackmailed me by threatening me to give him my
    remaining HotWheels cars.People can tell you right from wrong, but it’s up to you if you actually take that on
    boarder not.Thankfully this was something that set in at a young age.</p>
  <p>Like everyone else, I am NOT perfect. There is always room for improvement.I can have a hot head at times and not
    get be level headed, flustered and deflect on others.All things I try and slow myself down and work towards changing
    each day.</p>
  <p>But, I like people, including and learning about others, being kind, uplifting those around me, although I have a
    loud voice and am tall enough to notice half was down the block I try be respectful of others space. </p>
  <p>I come from a household with 2 parents that worked themselves to the brink of death to provide a safe home with a
    roof over mine and my sisters heads. This had ultimately translated to myself at 12-13 starting part time work and
    going right into working as soon as I left college, not wanting to be a burden. So far I have been working full time
    for 7 years I’ve been faced with my fair share of difficult times.</p>
  <p>I like teams and team building, being able to know your colleges weaknesses and being able to offer help when and
    where it will be useful helps so much in a work environment, especially if they don’t know how to ask for help or
    struggle to, like myself.</p>
