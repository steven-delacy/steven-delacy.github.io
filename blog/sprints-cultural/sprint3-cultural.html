    <h1>Understanding EQ</h1>
    <p>
      EQ is the ability to identify and understand emotions of ones self and the
      people around them.
    </p>
    <p>The use of EQ is but not limited to.
      - Evaluation
      - Express emotions openly & assess others
      - Understand emotions
      - Identifying and ability to learn from emotions
    </p>
    <p>
      EQ is important in all kinds of workspaces, almost all Leaders in the
      workplace with have some level of this working in conjunction with IQ to
      maximise not only their performance but finding a way to uplift others and
      cater to their way of learning & understanding.
    </p>

  <p>
    I personally can have a hard time understanding some concepts.Being a
    visual learner, having someone show me how to do something will make that
    new information sit a bit easier. At my recent job I was fortunate enough
    to be able to ask for some thing that required a more visual orientation
    and the support for how I learned was embraced. If I was confused or there
    was small rooms for improvement, there was one of two things that would
    come from it, either a simple slack message outlining the issue, and a
    follow up meeting with a visual representation for my benefit.

  <h1>The more commonly known, IQ.</h1>
  <p>
    Unlike EQ with the understanding of emotions, IQ is related more towards
    your technical outlook and comprehension. IQ is closely related to
    success with challenging tasks. The ability to analyse patterns,
    algorithms and use problem solving in a technical sense.
  </p>
  <p>
    With both IQ & EQ being important, itâ€™s just key to do things that
    stimulate the side of your mind that is related with IQ and problems
    solving. Exercise the things closely related with EQ as well, journaling,
    understanding your own and other emotions.
