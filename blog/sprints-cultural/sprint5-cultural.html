  <h1>Take a health potion, you'll need it</h1>
  <div>
    <p>Coming into foundations I was both shocked and pleasantly surprised at how up front the facilitators were. “This
      will be hard, but remember be kind to yourself” is more of less what Joseph had said to us in orientation. I now
      believe it wholeheartedly.Being the first time I’ve studied since college this was and still is a hard decision
      for
      me to make.Beyond the path will be treacherous but, on that path seems to be nothing but kindness, support and
      mentors to help you get to the end of this journey.</p>
    <p>I know that this time with the individuals in my cohort will be stressful and I personally know I will doubt my
      abilities. I’ve got an entire lifetime of teachers to prove wrong in my mind. “loud and distracting” was what
      nearly
      all teachers had written on my report cards, demonising me because they were too lazy to do their jobs to the
      fullest. I hope that EDA can show myself that I am more than that for my peace of mind and future career, where
      ever
      that may lead.</p>
    <p>Unfortunately learning things about ones self can take time and I don’t think I’ve realised 3 things currently. I
      do know I have a slight ego when it comes to some things.</p>
    <p>
      Butting heads happens at times. This has come as a result of surviving some stressful workplaces and keeping my
      boundaries and walls up. I want those walls to come down, I need better ways of dealing with conflict in work
      places than standing my ground when I may not even need to. Communication is a powerful thing, and if used
      correctly can include some incredible results.

      I’m scared. Being the first time studying since college, (which is 7 years ago) it can be daunting to jump back in
      the cockpit and take flight again. “What if I can’t learn?” “What if I’m not smart enough?”.
    </p>
    <p>
      I think a value that will become quite obvious very quickly is that we are all just people, learning something new
      or reacquainting ourselves with code. It’s important to be kind, patient, understanding and finally (not finally,
      I just can’t think of too much at this current time) teamwork!
    </p>
    <p>
      I was kind of shocked at how fast paced EDA is with learning. It has made me both intrigued and scared. The
      obvious questions come to ones mind “am I good enough to take this all on?”. But then again, this course is design
      that way. The teachers and all that create the support foundations here know this is a tough road, this is why
      they are so supportive and kind. They mirror to us what we can potentially become in this short course.

    <p>
      I had personally had a little trouble with Javascript, also being in charge of my own learning. It’s tough to get
      into a flow. I am hoping that once there is a bit more structure with being in the cohort, all will come together
      for me and my nervous reckless self with then become inspired to create, work with others and share.

    </p>

      I had heard a lot about EDA even before applying. Sure your goal is to try your help mould good developers, but
      then underlying tone is to make even better people. People that employers would actually love to have on their
      team. They make take a slight hit at the start with that person needing some help in the beginning. However, if
      you can problem solve by yourself and have the balls to ask questions when needed and to be a joy to work with,
      there is no reason why you shouldn’t be hired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Learning more core values is great, with a world that is already so disconnected I think it’s important to
      reconnect with being a person. A lot of the time people don’t know how to talk to employers or even spark up a
      great convocation in an interview. Sure being technically gifted has its benefits, but can only take you so
      far.The whole saying “it’s about who you know” that will get you jobs. Well that may be true, there always has to
      be some balance.In some cases this can’t be helped as much but as long as there is effort that is all that
      matters.

    </p>
    <p>
      In hind sight, I think I have more than enough to write about but TMI is a thing and I may have shared a bit
      already.
